# TrackYourBudget

## Desctiption
The purpose of this assignment was to add functionality to the already existing Budget Tracker application. The program should allow for offline access and functionality, meaning that the user should be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without connection. When the application is brought back online, then the offline entries should be added to their tracker. Below, you'll find a quick checklist as to what the User story was and what were the Accepted Criteria:

```
AS AN avid traveller
I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection
SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling


GIVEN a user is on Budget App without an internet connection
WHEN the user inputs a withdrawal or deposit
THEN that will be shown on the page, and added to their transaction history when their connection is back online.
```
